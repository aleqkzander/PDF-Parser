  ## Information
  PDF-Parser scans a designated folder for PDF files, presenting them in a listbox. The tool efficiently indexes the text content, facilitating seamless filtering. When a filter is applied, only PDFs containing the specified text are displayed, streamlining the search 
  process. Upon double-clicking a listbox item, the content opens in another window.

  ## Notes
  Text content exclusively is indexed for enhanced search capabilities.
